ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pawan

I'm interested in coaching, mentoring, and programming! Currently learning how to implement compilers using "Crafting Interpreters" and writing it in Rust.

I'm looking to collaborate on coaching and mentoring opportunities in software development.

You can find me on Twitter [@minifiedpc](https://twitter.com/minifiedpc).
